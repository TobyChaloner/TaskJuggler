Inheritance
------------
PJ-Perl -> PsProjet
	      |   \
	      __  __
	      \/  \/
	 Projet   PsTaskList
              \     /  \ 
              __   __   __
	      \/   \/   \/
	     TaskList   PsTask
	        \      /
		__   __
		\/   \/
	         Task

Task List is multi inherited, but 1st to be seen is always the Projet one.
